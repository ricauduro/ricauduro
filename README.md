- 👋 Hi, I’m @ricauduro. I´m a data engineer and I like to work with Python to develop new things that can integrate what I see on the screen with what I see off the screen.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning things that can improve my skills with new techs and I also like helping others in their projects, professional or personal ones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end development with Python 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to IOT / automation, using Python and Arduino.
